      <details itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
        <summary itemprop="name">What is Plain Language – and when is it useful?</summary>
        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
          <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Plain Language is a highly simplified form of language with fixed rules. It uses short sentences (max. 8-12 words), simple grammar (active instead of passive), clear words without jargon and logical structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Target audience:</strong> People with learning difficulties, cognitive limitations, low reading skills or language learners.</p>
            <p><strong>Legally required for:</strong> Federal authorities (Germany), public websites (BITV 2.0) and election information.</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Short sentences (max. 8-12 words)</li>
              <li>Familiar words, no jargon without explanation</li>
              <li>Active instead of passive</li>
              <li>Concrete time information instead of 'reasonable period'</li>
              <li>Visual aids and line breaks after sense units</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p><em>Before:</em> "Within the framework of residence permit examination, the submission of biometric photographs is mandatory."</p>
            <p><em>After:</em> "You need new photos for your application. The photos must look like this: biometric. Bring 2 photos with you."</p>

        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">

            <dl>
              <dt>Plain Language:</dt>
              <dd>Max. 8-12 words per sentence, no genitive, no subjunctive, test group recommended</dd>
              <dt>Easy-to-Read:</dt>
              <dd>Max. 15-20 words, subordinate clauses allowed, genitive sparingly, no mandatory test group</dd>
            </dl>
            <p><strong>Core differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Plain Language = maximally accessible, strictly regulated</li>
              <li>Easy-to-Read = generally understandable, pragmatic</li>
              <li>Plain Language: 8-12 words/sentence, Easy-to-Read: 15-20 words/sentence</li>
              <li>Plain Language often needs test group, Easy-to-Read doesn't</li>
              <li>Both improve accessibility, but different rigor</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Plain Language target:</strong> People with cognitive limitations</p>

          <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Bureaucracy simplification means: translating complex official and administrative language into clear, understandable plain text – while maintaining legal precision.</p>
            <p><strong>Typical applications:</strong> Official notices, forms, contracts &amp; terms, emails from authorities, tenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Citizens immediately understand what is expected and what consequences threaten – without law degree.</p>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Fewer queries, higher compliance, better trust.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear language instead of bureaucratic language</li>
              <li>Legal precision remains intact</li>
              <li>Application: notices, forms, contracts, emails</li>
              <li>Fewer queries, higher completion rate</li>
